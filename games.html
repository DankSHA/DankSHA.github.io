            and processes learned however would not consider myself much of a blog  writer and do not intend to make the posts 100% professional and more organic showing the learning process.
            As you can tell this isnt actually the and therefore i will go into quick detail about the current state of the game and also the games premise. <br> Once hosting  a game upto 9
            more friends can currently join with steam or a browser, when everyone has joined and in the ready up area the game begins and teleports all players to the map, They also get assigned
            a role which is either possessed or worker. The possessed must kill all the other players and can sabotage points on the map (Currently 0% feature complete). The workers get assigned
            a set amount of task, this is where i currently am, The premise from there is they must compete all the tasks without the possessed killing everyone! Although there are no killing
            features yet i have implemented to an early access ready version; motion matched character system,inventory system, simple interaction ,interactable and task spawns, 3 diffrent
            simple tasks. All of these things are fully replicated and i am currently working on the task distribution and tracking system, after this i want to focus on making the game as
            feature complete as possible for the simple gameplay loop, once this is in place id like to polish this version with animations, enviroments and user interfaces so i can release a
             sort of internal alpha test between some of my gaming buddies. I am currently relying on multiple fab assests for the botched map however for testing and gameplay feedback purposes
              using these assets can help the early players much more easily fit the mood. Theres still so much more i could mention id like to work on but this is just a base opening introduction
